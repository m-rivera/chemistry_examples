\section{Mode locking}

The following Python script will plot the structure of pulses generated by a mode-locked laser. \par\medskip 
\noindent The script uses equation (49) from the lecture materials to plot intensity:
\[I(t)\propto E^*(t)E(t) = E_0^2\frac{\sin^2(N\pi ct/2L)}{\sin^2(\pi ct/2L)}\]

\section{How to use the script}
Cavity length, along with the number of superimposed cavity modes can be adjusted. Running the script by clicking Activate, followed by Run, will produce a plot.

\section{Things to try}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the script and take note of the parameters and formulae. Run the code.
\item Adjust the number of cavity modes to 3. Make predictions of what the plot should look like and run the script.
\item Adjust the number of cavity modes to 1 and run the script. Can you explain what happens?
\item What happens when you adjust cavity length?
\end{enumerate}
