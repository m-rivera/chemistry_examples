\section{NMR coupling}

The following Python script will plot splitting patterns. This is done by plotting overlapping Gaussian curves with means determined by the coupling constants.

\section{How to use the script}
Various parameters can be adjusted: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{n} - number of protons for each couple (eg. Doublet = [1], Triplet = [2], Doublet of Triplets = [1, 2]).
\item \texttt{J\_coupling\_constants} - coupling constants for each couple described by n.
\item \texttt{standard\_deviation} - standard deviation of the Gaussian distributions. This modifies the width of each peak.
\end{itemize}
Running the script by clicking Activate, followed by Run, will produce a plot of the splitting pattern.

\section{Things to try}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the script and take note of the parameters and formulae. Run the code.
\item Alter the parameters. Make predictions of what the plot should look like and run the script. Repeat a couple times until your predictions are correct.
\end{enumerate}
