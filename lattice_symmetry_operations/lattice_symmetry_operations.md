# Lattice symmetry operations

The following Python script will plot the the position of an atom in a lattice and perform a user-defined symmetry operation to plot the position of a second atom.

## How to use the script

The initial position of the atom can be adjusted by changing the value of initial_coords. Similarly, the symmetry operation (sym_operation) can be changed. Running the script, will produce a 3D plot.

## Things to try

1. Read the script and draw 3D axes showing the starting and ending positions of the atom. Run the code. Was your drawing correct?

2. Try Part 1 again with various operations, including translations and rotations.
    - Example for translation:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1+x, y, z
    - Example for rotation:&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;-x, -y, z
    - A more complex example:&emsp;&emsp;-y, x-y, z
