\section{Lattice symmetry operations}

The following Python script will plot the the position of an atom in a lattice and perform a user-defined symmetry operation to plot the position of a second atom.

\section{How to use the script}
The initial position of the atom can be adjusted by changing the value of \texttt{initial\_coords}. Similarly, the symmetry operation (\texttt{sym\_operation}) can be changed. Running the script by clicking Activate, followed by Run, will produce a 3D plot.

\section{Things to try}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read the script and draw the plot. Run the code. Was your drawing correct?
\item Try Part 1 again with various operations, including translations and rotations.
\begin{itemize}
\item Example for translation:\tab1+x, y, z
\item Example for rotation:\tab-x, -y, z
\item A more complex example:\tab-y, x-y, z
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
