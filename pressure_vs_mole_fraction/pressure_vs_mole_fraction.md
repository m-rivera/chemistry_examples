# Pressure vs mole fraction
The following Python script will plot three lines one for each of the partial pressures of an ideal, two component system and one for the total pressure of the system.

## How to use the script
The pressures of the pure components can be altered in the script. Running the script by clicking Activate, followed by Run, will produce the plot. The units parameter can be changed to alter the label on the y-axis.

## Things to try
1. Alter the partial pressures of pure A and B. Do you get the result you expected?
